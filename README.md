I built this app on top of the UI framework [Dashboard Reborn](https://github.com/urmilshroff/dashboard_reborn).
Subsequent changes to that template have been my own.

## You Can Make Your Own App Too ðŸš€


-   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/) by following the instructions on their website.
-   Fork/clone the template repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/urmilshroff/dashboard_reborn.git`.
-   Download the Dart and Flutter plugins in the IDE of your choosing
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app by clicking the green play button in your IDE
-   Play around and have fun with it!

Note: you can also run it faster in debug mode using `flutter run`, but the animations will be choppy and performance won't be as expected.
